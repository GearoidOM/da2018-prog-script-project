Data:- [Iris Data Set](IrisData/iris.data.txt)

### Introduction
The Iris Data Set was first examined by British statistician Ronald Aylmer Fisher in his paper 'The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems' published in 1936[1]. In the paper he credits Dr E Anderson for the data measurement and it is sometimes also referred to as Anderson's Iris Dats Set in the literature because of this.
The data is comprised of 150 measurements. The measurements are of the flowers of fifty plants of three species of Iris; Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor & Iris-virginica. Four flower measurements are given for each species; Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length & Petal width[^ref1].
